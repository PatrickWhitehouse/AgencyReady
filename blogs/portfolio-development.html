                    <p>In this blog post, I’ll be explaining the reasoning behind my choices of layout, colours and fonts used within this website.  Not only will I be explaining the aesthetics of the website, I’ll also be exploring into the back end of the site and introducing the tools I used along the way which may or may not have helped me speed up the process of achieving my goal of creating a professional portfolio.</p>

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>I have never been fond of the research stage, however, I’ve learnt how important it is in order to develop a website!  Nonetheless, for the creation of my portfolio it was a vital necessity that I carried out a portion of research in order to help guide myself through the design and build stages.  </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>The first step I had taken to achieve my goal was to look at common features of other portfolios. For this, I used <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" title="External link to awwwards">awwwards</a>. The reason I had chosen <a href="http://www.awwwards.com" title="External link to awwwards">awwwards</a> as my main source of research was because all of the websites listed within
                        the directory have been nominated or given a web award of some sort. This gave me the confidence that the authors of the listed websites knew what they were on doing in terms of design. From here I took simple notes of layouts, colour schemes and
                        typography which I found attractive.</p>

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the design stage, I used a variety of methods. Firstly, I created  sketches with a piece of paper and pencil. The sketching step allowed me to quickly draft ideas regardless of my drawing abilities. I tried to incorporate my layout research into my sketches in order to make it clear to myself what was achievable and realistic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After I had come up with a few simplistic designs on paper, I then moved onto turning them into a bunch of electronic wireframes using <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a>, a design application for Mac. I found <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a> the best option as I could pick from defualt template art boards, which
                        are already built into the application upon installation, to help imitate different screen resolutions and devices.
                    </p>

                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>
                        Based on my research I was able to implement my colour scheme and typography into the wireframes inside of <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a>. <a href="http://www.sketchapp.com" title="View the official Sketch app homepage">Sketch</a> allows full flexibility of fonts and allowed myself to edit multiple elements of the font such as font weight, letter spacing, line
                        height and text decoration.

                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>
                        I planned thoroughly before I begun developing my portfolio. I thought about the tools which are available to assist me with the development and also the languages and their functionalities.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>
                        I decided to use HTML and CSS to give the website a structure and some styling. I also used a small amount of Javascript to add functionality. Alongside these, I decided to use SASS as a pre-processor for CSS. The reason behind this was that SASS allowed me to create variables and mixins which meant I could reuse a block of code without having to go through the pain of retyping it every time it was needed.
                        <img src="../images/sass_example.jpg" alt="Example of how SASS is used" class="blog-example">
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>
                        Other than languages, I found <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub official homepage">Git</a> extremely useful whilst I was developing. Git allowed me to constantly log my changes and revert back to an older version if something went wrong. My main use of <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> was that it allowed me to automate the conversion
                        of SCSS (SASS) files to CSS.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>
                        I also used <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" title="Official Gulp homepage">Gulp</a> for other features such as <a href="https://www.browsersync.io/" title="Browsersync homepage">Browsersync</a> which allowed me to create a localhost server and enabled me to view my website on different devices simultaneously without having to upload it to a web server every time there was a change. This
                        helped speed up my responsive development immensely as I could edit the webpage and style sheet live thus meaning it would update instantly on the device I was viewing it on.
