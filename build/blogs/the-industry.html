                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>Ever since I can remember, I have always shown an interest in the digital industry, specifically the web side of the industry. I’ve always been fascinated by the web, especially as it can fulfil thousands of user needs. Before I delved
                        into both the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/ManchesterDigital/manchester-digital-skills-audit-2016-results" title="Skills Summit Summary presentation slides">Manchester Digital Skills Summit slide deck</a> and the <a href="http://www.techcityuk.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Tech-Nation-2016_FINAL-ONLINE-1.pdf" title="Tech City UK 2016 Report">Tech Nation Report</a>, I had already presumed that I had the correct skills behind me in order to stand a good chance finding a career after graduating. The slide deck
                        and tech report have given me a great insight into the industry and have helped open my eyes and understand what real employers actually look for in a university student like myself.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>As I want to pursue a career in web development, more specifically, front end development, I thought knowing and learning the basics of HTML and CSS was enough. I was wrong. I figured out I also needed to know a little bit of JavaScript
                        too. I therefore learnt the basics of JavaScript and started combining this with HTML and CSS. I believed I now had the skillset needed by any employer for a front end development role. This however still wasn't enough. The report specifies that
                        quite a lot of digital agencies require/look for people who have knowledge in PHP, regardless of the role you’re trying to grab. I was shocked by this statement as I hadn’t appreciated that PHP was such a vital language to know.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>On the other hand, I was glad to see that near enough the majority of the agencies within the industry employ graduates or have graduate specific roles in place. This gave me reassurance that I’m going to be able to find a career after
                        university. From the report I also learnt that development was one of the hardest roles for the industry to fill thus meaning that contractors had to be brought in. This has motivated me to keep enhancing my skills and also learning
                        new skills in hope that I could be an asset to the industry after I have graduated.</p>

                        In order to keep up to date with the standards and latest technologies based around the digital industry, I like to use a variety of social platforms which allow me to follow key figures. I tend to use Twitter the most. Twitter allows me to follow people
                        who I see as being an influence in the digital industry. Twitter also allows me to reach out to potential employers and furthermore, allows me to ask for help or help others when needed. Below is a list of users I follow:

                    <p>
                        I believe it is important to keep learning and advancing your skillset in order to stay in date with the latest technologies. There are plenty of resources I use in order to do so. I like to watch video tutorials on YouTube by an individual called
                        <a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DevTipsForDesigners" title="DevTips Youtube channel">DevTips</a>. He offers a wide range of videos which I find very useful. The main reason I enjoy watching tutorials is because I like to learn how other professionals work and what tools they use. Although I prefer watching videos,
                            I do however enjoy reading blog posts posted by <a href="http://css-tricks.com" title="CSS Tricks website">CSSTricks</a> (Chris Coyer).

                </div>
                <div class="col-full">
                    <p>
                        To finish off, I think the digital industry is advancing at an immense rate. We’re constantly seeing new technologies being introduced on a weekly basis, if not day to day basis! As someone who wants to have a career in the digital industry, it’s important
                        to keep learning about the new technologies and gaining as many skills as you can. Not only does having several skills look good on your CV, it shows your potential employers that you are capable of filling other roles within the
                        agency/industry. After I’ve graduated, I hope my list of skills has grown and I will hopefully have the skillset required in order to fill a role within the digital industry.
