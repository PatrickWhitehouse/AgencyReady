          <p>Hi, I'm Patrick. You should already know the basics about me from the introduction paragraph on the home page! Well, if you didn't read that, my name is Patrick Whitehouse and I am currently a student at Manchester Metropolitan University. I'm in my final year studying Web Development (BSc). </p>

          <p>I'm currently living in a town just outside of Manchester city centre named Denton. I've lived here all my life however I don't plan on living here forever! The world is a big place and I feel that I need to explore it before it's too late. On the topic of travelling, I've been very fortunate to have visited numerous of places. Once I have gained experience in the digital industry, I hope that I can take my skills overseas and reside in the US or Australia. </p>

          <p>I have always been an outgoing individual. During my early teenage years, I was very fortunate to have been given the oppourtunity to play for a professional football club, Rochdale AFC. I was a footballer here for roughly two years before being released. I decided to experience a new sport and decided to compete in basketball. Again, I progressed quite far in this sport. Sporting achievements aside, I have won multiple academic awards at my high school. At school I was a hard working individual who wanted the best grades possible. </p>

          <p>Before coming to university, I attended a sixth form college where I studied ICT. From a young age I have always known that IT will shape my future and be a key part in my life. My father too has always been in the IT industry (network category) and therefore I learnt a lot at an early age from him.</p>
